==========

This repository is the PHP web front-end of [SCUTOJ][1]. [SCUTOJ][1] is an open source Online Judge System estabished by South China University of Technology, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. It's based on another open source project [HUSTOJ](http://code.google.com/p/hustoj). At present, it can provide the basic service of judging system, but our system is still evolving so far. 

As one of the developers, I hope it can be used for both ACM/ICPC contest and teaching purpose in the future, deeply.
